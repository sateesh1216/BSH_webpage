    history:
      "Tucked into the Eastern Ghats near the Odisha border, Araku Valley has been home to indigenous Adivasi communities for centuries, long before it appeared on any tourist map. Surrounded by the Ananthagiri and Sunkarimetta reserve forests and ringed by the Raktakonda, Chitamogondi, Galikonda and Sunkarimetta hills, the valley sits at an average elevation of roughly 900–1,300 metres. Galikonda is the tallest hill in Andhra Pradesh, giving the valley some of its most dramatic viewpoints.\n\nModern tourism took off in the early 1960s when the South Central Railway carved out the Kirandul–Araku line, an engineering feat of dozens of tunnels and bridges through the Eastern Ghats that turned the journey itself into an attraction. Coffee arrived a little earlier: the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department introduced Arabica cultivation in the 1950s to give tribal farmers a sustainable livelihood, growing the beans in the shade of silver oak trees exactly as it's still done today. In 2007, tribal growers launched Araku Emerald, India's first organic coffee brand from indigenous farmers, which has since earned a GI tag and international recognition.\n\nBeyond coffee, Araku's culture is built around its tribal roots — the Dhimsa folk dance, weekly tribal shandies (markets) selling bamboo crafts and jewellery, and festivals like Itika Pongal keep that heritage very much alive.",

Word of its unusual winter chill spread mostly by travellers' accounts, and the village has only recently grown into an organised weekend getaway, still refreshingly free of the crowds and commercial sprawl found at bigger hill stations.",

According to temple legend, Lord Vishnu appeared here in a unique combined form, Varaha-Narasimha (part boar, part lion), to protect his devotee Prahlada from his father, the demon king Hiranyakashipu. To this day the deity is kept covered year-round in sandalwood paste, resembling a lingam, and is revealed in its true form only once a year during the Chandanotsavam festival on Akshaya Tritiya.\n\nInscriptions on the temple walls date back to 1098 CE, from the reign of the Chola king Kulottunga I, making its documented history nearly a thousand years old. It was later expanded and patronised by the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Chalukyas, and the Vijayanagara Empire — Krishnadevaraya himself is said to have donated gold and a victory pillar that still stands on the grounds. Architecturally, the temple resembles a fortress, with three enclosing courtyards, five gateways, and a blend of Kalinga, Chalukya and Chola styles culminating in a five-tiered rajagopuram.",

    history:
      "Thotlakonda takes its name from the Telugu for \"hill of stone wells,\" a reference to the rock-cut cisterns carved into its bedrock to store water for resident monks. The site was rediscovered by the Indian Navy during an aerial survey in the 1970s while scouting locations for a naval base, and excavated by the Andhra Pradesh State Archaeology Department through the 1980s and early '90s. What emerged was a 120-acre Hinayana Buddhist monastic complex dating to roughly the 3rd century BCE–2nd century CE, thought to have housed upward of 100 monks and served as a rest stop for maritime traders along the Bay of Bengal. Excavations turned up Satavahana-era coins, Roman silver coins, terracotta tiles, carved stupa models and Buddha footprint reliefs, pointing to trade links stretching as far as the Roman Empire.",

    history:
      "Visakhapatnam Airport (IATA: VTZ) operates as a civil enclave inside INS Dega, an Indian Navy air station, reflecting the city's long-standing role as home to the Eastern Naval Command. Civilian flights began modestly in 1981 with a single daily service on a short 1,800-metre runway.\n\nThe real transformation came in the 2000s: a new 10,500-foot runway capable of handling wide-body aircraft was inaugurated in June 2007, night-landing capability followed soon after, and a modern integrated terminal with aerobridges opened in March 2009. These upgrades earned the airport international status, with direct flights launched to Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. It has run 24-hour operations since 2014 and even added a 2-megawatt solar power plant in 2016 to lower its carbon footprint — reflecting Visakhapatnam's growth into a major industrial, IT and port city.",
